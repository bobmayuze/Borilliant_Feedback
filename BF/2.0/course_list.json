The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations.

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle.When Offered: Fall and summer annually.Credit Hours: 2",

Digital techniques will be investigated as developmental tools rather than an assistant representational technology. Parametric modeling will also be utilized to help manage and clarify complex relationships between systems and environments. We will be working with a master model / Building Information Modeling (BIM) logic, in which a single application software will be the predominant digital resource, and workflow becomes essential to the successful development of the project. The computer, like any other design tool, has its place.

Light, intrinsically attached to the spatial experience, is able to affect, transform and stimulate not only our visual, but our mental and even bodily perception of things. As designers, we must understand the specifics of a given ambiance, its affects and mechanisms to cultivate a formal precision necessary to reproduce concrete experiences that we might be looking for. How can we use light, an intangible matter, as building material? How color, form and texture affect the ways light is diffused, reflected or aggregated? In other words, how they condition its different manifestations? What are the effects and the effects of the absence of light, shadow or twilight? This seminar intends to refine our ways of seeing and test these new observations through making. It is not about the use and interpretation of light through architectural history. It is about the study of light as a device that transforms or even generates space. It engages with the phenomenological and will compare different artifacts, buildings, and expressions that give an answer to similar questions with independence of the time and location they were created. We will study these different forms of light and their implicit meanings; their capacity to create different illusions, rhythms and relations.",

      "description": "Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student’s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life, and life cycle cost.
